 Introduction
--------------

Ardesia is a small tool to make annotations sketching 
on the screen.

Ardesia is XInput-Aware, so if you have a mouse, a graphic tablet, 
a touch screen or a whiteboard, you can draw lines with different strength,
select color, erase things and draw arrows. 
You can free-hand draw geometrical shapes using the shape recognizer, 
insert text with the keyboard and highlight screen areas. 
You can draw upon the desktop or select an image as background.

Ardesia has been designed with the Glade/GtkBuilder tool
and it use to draw the cairo graphics library.

 Runtime Requirements
----------------------

In order to run Ardesia you need to enable the Compiz composite manager.
To use the recording feature you must install the recordmydesktop 
package.
If you don't use the keyboard, I suggest you to use the "onboard" virtual
keyboard or the "cellwriter" handwriting recognizer.

-------
 Usage
-------

Start Ardesia clicking in the menu on Applications/Tools/Ardesia

You can annotate a png file on your desktop right clicking it
and selecting the "open with Ardesia" item

You can found some suitable backgrounds png examples under the folder
backgrounds:

e.g. /usr/local/share/ardesia/ui/backgrounds

Now you can select colors and annotate the screen.
If you want unlock the mouse and came back to the normal mouse use
point upon the ardesia bar or clicking upon the unlock icon. 

The default behaviour of ardesia is appear in the east zone of the screen
with a vertical layout.
If you want modify this launch ardesia from command line in this way:

# ardesia --gravity north

With Ardesia you can annotate image files such as png, jpeg and svg.

For example with this command you will have a lined paper 
similar to a notebook page:

# ardesia /usr/local/share/ardesia/backgrounds/notebook_paper.png

You can open the background image or color with the preference button.
