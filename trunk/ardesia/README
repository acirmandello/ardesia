 Introduction
--------------

Ardesia is a small tool to make annotations sketching 
on the screen.

Ardesia is XInput-Aware, so if you have a mouse, a graphic tablet, 
a touch screen or a whiteboard, you can draw lines with 
different strength. You can select color, erase things and draw arrows. 
You can free-hand draw geometrical shapes using the shape recognizer, 
insert text with the keyboard and highlight screen areas. 
You can draw upon the desktop or select a coloured layer or an image 
as a background.

Ardesia has been designed with the Glade/GtkBuilder tool
and it use to draw the cairo graphics library.

 Runtime Requirements
----------------------

In order to run Ardesia you need to enable the Compiz composite manager.
To use the recording feature you must install the recordmydesktop 
package.
If you don't use the keyboard, I suggest you to use the "onboard" virtual
keyboard or the "cellwriter" handwriting recognizer.

- From Command Line

The default behaviour of ardesia is appear in the east zone of the screen
with a vertical layout.
If you want modify this launch ardesia from command line in this way:

With Ardesia you can annotate image files such as png, jpeg and svg.

For example with this command you will have a lined paper 
similar to a notebook page:
