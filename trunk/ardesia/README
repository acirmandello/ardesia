 Introduction
--------------

Ardesia enables you to make colored free-hand annotations on your computer screen, 
record it and share on the network.

This is especially useful when making presentations, to highlight things or 
point out things of interest.

The tool facilitates the online presentations and demos showing in real time 
your computer screen to anyone in the network.


Ardesia is XInput-Aware, so if you have a mouse, a graphic tablet, 
a touch screen or a whiteboard, you can draw lines with 
different strength. You can select color, erase things and draw arrows. 

You can free-hand draw geometrical shapes using the shape recognizer, 
insert text with the keyboard and highlight screen areas. 

You can draw upon the desktop or select a coloured layer or an image 
as a background.

Ardesia has been designed with the Glade/GtkBuilder tool
and it use to draw the cairo graphics library.

 Installation

----------------------
 Runtime Requirements
----------------------

In order to run Ardesia you need to enable the Compiz composite manager.
To use the recording feature you must install the recordmydesktop 
package.
If you don't use the keyboard, I suggest you to use the "onboard" virtual
keyboard or the "cellwriter" handwriting recognizer.

point upon the ardesia bar or clicking upon the unlock icon. 


- From Command Line

The default behaviour of ardesia is appear in the east zone of the screen
with a vertical layout.
If you want modify this launch ardesia from command line in this way:

# ardesia --gravity north

With Ardesia you can annotate image files such as png, jpeg and svg.

For example with this command you will have a lined paper 
similar to a notebook page:

# ardesia /usr/local/share/ardesia/backgrounds/notebook_paper.png


Here it follows a complete description of the options for the Ardesia:

-----------------
 Troubleshooting
-----------------

- Ardesia does not start and says that you must enable a composite manager
  - setup your computer to use the accelerated graphic drivers
    - intel graphics card might work with the free driver
    - nvidia graphics driver you must install the proprietary driver
    - ati you must install the propietary driver
  - go in the Gnome panel in System/Preference/Appereance and put 
    the visuals effect to normal

- Ardesia bar is not full visible, it is greater than my desktop
  - try to put the bar in orizontal position with the gravity option
    e.g. ardesia -g south

- I can not move the Ardesia Bar. Why?
  - I have put the bar in the right of the screen because is the best 
    position to be accessible with the hand and it does not hide
    important thinks on the desktop
    Anyway you can choose the position starting the Ardesia bar
    with the decorate option
    e.g. ardesia -d
    Now you can move the ardesia bar everywhere

- Ardesia is not able to record my desktop
  - verify that you audio driver works fine, recording some speach
    with an other program
  - install the recordmydesktop package (it's required)
  - if you have other problems try to customize the 
    $PREFIX/share/ardesia/scripts/recordmydesktop_screencast.sh
  - For the recordmydesktop comnfiguration please visit
    http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php

- I have read that with Ardesia I can put my presentation on the web.
  How I can do this?
  - Ardesia supports the live screencast streaminf 
    only after that you have configured the file
    properly
    In order to make a presentation you must have:
    - A running icecast2 server 
      (if you want to be reachable from Internet this machine must have
       a public IP address and a domain name)
    - A local machine that you use to make the presentation
      This computer must:
      - reach the icecast2 server
      - have ardesia installed
      - have ezstream installed (it is used to forward the stream to the server) 
    - Open the file $PREFIX/share/ardesia/scripts/recordmydesktop_screencast.sh
      And Uncomment the line
        - ICECAST="TRUE";
      To enable the streaming ezstream configuration file located on
      $PREFIX/share/ardesia/scripts/ezstream_stdin_ardesia.xml
      In this file you must configure properly:
        - location
        - port 
        - password
        - mountpoint
    - Open Ardesia
    - Push the record button
    - Select a name
    - Enjoy the stream
      at the uri 
      http://location:port/mountpoint.ogv
    - Now you can put this link on a web page or publish it in an other way
    - For furthermore information about icecast2 server visit http://www.icecast.org/
